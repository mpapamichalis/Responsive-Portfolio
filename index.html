                <p><i>Hello world and welcome! Below is a quick introduction on how I got started in web
                        development.</i></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My name is Mary Papamichalis and I work in operations and sales for a fine arts service company
                    in Dallas. If you dont know, fine art service companies are the very important but typically unsung
                    heros of the artworld. Similar to a stagehand in film/ theater, art handlers- pack, transport, and
                    install artwork. Simply put, we would not have the frequent exposure to creative expression from the
                    ever changing exhibitions
                    our local museums offer without art handlers. As you may now have guessed,I have an affinity for
                    art. I graduated from
                    UNT with a BFA in art history.

                    Shortly after graduation I found myself working in a cut throat and fast paced
                    environment where I had the priviledge of the very few who actually get to touch the art and other
                    historical antiquities.

                    You may be asking yourself, why the shift from art history to web development? Well, I'll tell you!
                    Most likely a similar story to your own, after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Unitied States in early 2020, I was
                    furloughed. For the first time in over a decade I had nothing to do. I was stuck at home with nothing to do and
                    no obliations leading to no direction. Shortly after quarantine began, I caught up on the growing lists I had made of shows and movies
                    on everyone's favorite streaming services. Weeks turned into months, Summer hit and the world realized that things were not going
                    to return to normal. Businesses began to close their doors and I worried what my future would look like after a pandemic. 
                    The world was filled with a growing sense of uncertainty but one thing was definite... coding! It was time for a real
                    change and a promise of sustainability. I sought out a carreer path that could be resilient to outside forces and only grow
                    in demand as time went by. Oh, and working remotely is a definite perk!I'm still at the begining of this journey and I know without a
                    doubt I made the right choice.
