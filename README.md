# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
Requirments for this project were to use bootstrap to make a more responsive application, so that no matter the screen size the application's content is displayed proportionally for the user. Specifically we were required to include a navbar and make sure the layout and images included were responsive.
